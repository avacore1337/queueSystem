				Administrators are the supreme rulers of Stay A While, with privileges to perform just about anything.
				Their primary purpose is adding new queues, and adding teachers for those queues.

				To add an administrator, go to the <a href="/#/administration">Administration</a> page. Then enter the name of the
				user you wish to add as administrat in the field under <em>Administrators</em> and click <em>Add</em>.

			<h3>Queue status</h3>
			<p>
				The queues in Stay A While can have different statuses, which can be good to know.

					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>

					<td>The queue is locked and can't be joined</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>

			<h3 id="findAQueue">Find a queue</h3>
			<p>
				The first step to queueing would be to find the queue you wish to join, right? So how is that done?
				Well, first go to the <a href="/#/queues">Queues</a> page. There you can either scroll to find the queue
				you are searching for, or you could search for the queue. To scroll, just scroll - more info on
				scrolling will not be covered in this help section.

				To search for a queue, type the queue name (or parts of the queue name) in the box that looks like this:
				<img src="/images/find-queues-box.png" alt="Find Queues box">
			</p>

			<h3>Join a queue</h3>
			<p>
				To join a queue, you will first need to find the queue (see <a href="/#/help#findAQueue">Find a queue</a>).
				When you have found the queue, let's say you want to join the queue <em>Allmänhandledning</em>,
				click the queue name.
			</p>
			<img src="/images/allmanhand.png" alt="Allmänhandledning">
			<p>
				You now reach the queue page, where all the queueing takes place. If you are at a KTH computer, your
				location will be automatically obtained.
			</p>
			<img src="/images/location.png" alt="Your location">
			<p>
				If your location is not automatically obtained, please type your location in the location field.
			</p>
			<p>Now click the <em>Join queue</em> button, and you are done!</p>
			<p><em>Note: On the queue list page, the queues you are currently queueing in become blue.</em></p>

			<h3>Leave a queue</h3>
			<p>
				To leave a queue, you must first join a queue. If you haven't joined the queue you want to leave,
				we recommend you to not join that queue. If you have already joined the queue you want to leave,
				go to the main page of the queue and click the <em>Leave queue</em> button.
			</p>

		<div ng-show="accessLevel < 0">
			<h2 style="margin-top: 0;" id="quest">Guests</h2>
			<p>
				You are not logged in. If you only want to view a queue, that's cool,
				but to be able to join a queue, you will need to
				<a href="/#/login">log in</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>Viewing a queue</h4>
			<p>
				If you don't want to log in, you can open up any queue and see the virtual line of eagerly
				waiting people. This is done by clicking the name of the queue you want to look at in the
				<a href="/#/queues">Queues</a> page.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you want to look at the queue for <em>Allmänhandledning</em>,
				you click like this:
